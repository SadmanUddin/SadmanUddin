# Hey guys, I'm Mohammed Sadman Uddin!

I'm a student who loves to code â€” simply because it's fun.Basically I'm into software development and Data science.  
Currently,pursuing bachelors in data science, protection, and cybersecurity.

I'm not an expert, but In Sha Allah, I'll keep learning and growing.  
My goal is to become a skilled developer and data analyst.

If you're working on an ASP.NET project and need help with site deployment.. feel free to shoot a text I'd be happy to assist and have a cup of tea.
