# Hey guys, I'm Mohammed Sadman Uddin!

I'm a student who loves to code â€” simply because it's fun.Currently,pursuing bachelors in data science, protection, and cybersecurity.

I'm not an expert, but In Sha Allah, I'll keep learning and growing.  
My goal is to become a skilled developer and data analyst.

If you're working on an ASP.NET project and need help with site deployment or any kind of stack.. feel free to shoot a text I'd be happy to assist and have a cup of tea.Maybe i can learn something from you as well.
